# Story of this app: 
 Learning Programming is a skill parents are looking for their kids.  You can look online to some online and offline alternatives, but there is not a place where they can look for different types of courses, or where teachers/companies can publish and promote   It is exhausting and requires a lot of effort and energy because of not knowing where to go to find what they are looking for.  This app wants to help shoppers find the item they need, by provinding them the store name, details and location where their item is being sold.  

# Audience:
Parents and students who are looking for a coding course.  Teachers and companies who want to publish and promote their Coding Courses.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Resources used to create this app
This project used images are taken from different online sources, the links to those images are on the db.json file. 

CSS: This project started using the CSS in the Flatiron React Router Lab.  But then, it was changed for making it work for this projects.  I also used Bootstrap for the videos at the HOME Components.
